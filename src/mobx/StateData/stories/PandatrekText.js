    As I did not have a bank account back then I was really interested in bitcoin, as it gave me the possibility to be my own bank. There was a website called bitmit.net. It was like ebay, but with bitcoin as the only available pay option. So I offered my service to write a website.<br />
    <br />
    Actually I worked on 2 websites on bitmit.net, the first was a coin collector site, but that was a small one; finished in about 4 days, so I will not go into detail about that.<br />
    <br />
    I got all requirements for the website as a pdf and worked on it at least every second day, while working on a milestone.<br />
    <br />
    As the page was almost finished and the last payment of 15 Bitcoin was still open, I was told, because bitcoin skyrocketed he or she cannot pay me anymore. That person was in australia and I only got the email adress, so sadly not much I could do about it.<br />
    <br />
    The site worked as the requirements stated, altough that website would not have met the quality demands I have today towards myself. So it was a project from which I got mostly a lot of experience.<br />
    <br />
    And just in case you are wondering: No, I don&apos;t have the 35 Bitcoin anymore that I was payed before the last payment. I was young and spent the money - back then ~1000â‚¬ - on everyday stuff. No regrets.<br />
    <br />
    A working backup does exist.
