      The place I am currently working at.<br />
      <br />
      I really enjoy working here. I have the chance to live out my inner nerd, work with very pleasant teammates and get to apply most of what I&apos;ve learned till today in a supporting environment.<br />
      <br />
      What I also really appreciate is that the team I&apos;m working with does custom integrations. So to say: We do everything not covered by the &quot;standard&quot; emarsys solution. So the developing tasks are (almost) never boring and I get to learn a lot of new stuff.<br />
      <br />
      As this is my first &quot;real&quot; job as a developer I&apos;m also quite happy to see my skills beeing applicable to real world problems, creating well documented codebases (when I haven&apos;t been sure before, if I might get lazy with time) and positive feedback from our customers.
