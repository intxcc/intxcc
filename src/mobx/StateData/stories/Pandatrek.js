  summary: 'The first job I\'ve ever done, while I was still in school. I got the requirements in a pdf-file and completed the job in about 150 work hours. The task at hand was a carsharing site for an australian person. All payments were payed to me in bitcoin. Sadly, as bitcoin skyrocketed he or she was not a fan of the project anymore and stopped paying me, so the website is not available anymore.'
