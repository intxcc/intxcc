  summary: 'The basic concept is a self hosted tracking app for privacy aware people. It\'s quite a niche project, but I wrote it mostly fitting my own usecase anyway. Nevertheless I put great demands to the documentation to make it available for anybody obtaining a copy. With a complete youtube tutorial, a play store entry and a well documented code base.'
