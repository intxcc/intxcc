    The intention of thehackcamp.org was educational and to catch attention. To convey some basic knowledge about IT security. The objective was to awaken peoples curiosity and to interest them for security in the IT world.<br />
    <br />
    This is why the design was strictly adapted to the target group. To paint a mystical and powerful picture. Orange on black. Text white. Minimalistic. No rounded corners. There was a warning before one could visit the site, a hidden service, a manifest and as background an image with serious looking people in suits and guy fawkes masks, that merge into the black background.<br />
    <br />
    To make the site popular I did guerrilla marketing myself on various darknet sites. Also there was a countdown before the start of the website and an invite system.<br />
    <br />
    After the countdown had expired there were more than 100 people on the website at the same time - keep in mind that all this happened on the darknet, were the population is far lower than on the clearnet. There was a clearnet mirror though. But only to get attention and with a FAQ that explained how to reach the darknet site. Also there were almost as much new accounts on that day.<br />
    <br />
    The project was temporarily listed in the well known hidden wiki. But I dropped the project, because the cost and time to operate a secure hidden service is high and I didn&apos;t want to just let it stay online half-cooked.<br />
    <br />
    A working backup does exist.
