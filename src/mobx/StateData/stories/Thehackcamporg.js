  summary: 'I would say this project is outstanding in my portfolio. Not because it was the best thing I ever brought online, but this hidden service/website was the most interesting and fun for me to establish in the darknet. To create a mystical aura around the project and to catch the attention of (metaphorically) everybody standing by.'
