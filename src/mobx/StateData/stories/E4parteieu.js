  summary: 'This was a project focussed on creating a new political party that rooted in a german subreddit on the social media platform reddit. I was the technical lead, responsible for the complete collaborative infrastructure. From backend to frontend. From running a secure debian server with all kinds of tools to connect everybody working together on this project, to creating a website with a customized poll platform with reddit API integration.'
